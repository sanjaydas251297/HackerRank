# Here’s the most efficient way to learn in this context:
### Read a piece of code.
### Understand all features of the language that are being used there.
### Understand all the features of the libraries/frameworks that are being used there.
### Learn the basics of those libraries/frameworks.
### Understand what every line does and the purpose of those libraries/frameworks in the context of that piece of code.
